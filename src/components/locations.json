We were able to see the tree from the top to the bottom. We were able to watch the Saks Fifth Avenue show. I we'll see they had it pretty organized by closing down the streets, which gives a lot more space. They had an entrance in and an entrance out exit only, which really helped with the crowd control. But overall, it was beautiful. My in-laws enjoyed it. My bonus son, who has never been really, had a great time."

Once we found out where the barricade ended and was able to get into the space, we found a nice little spot that wasn't as crowded and we just took it all in. If you're not into crowds or suffer from claustrophobia, I would recommend going during the day. Best pics are at night when you can truly experience the beauty of it all. Stay safe! Happy Holidays"

The elevator ride was the first big WOW moment that went over the history of the building and then to the observation deck. With a focus on being environmentally friendly, students and educators and even the general public would be interested in knowing. These are just some of the pictures I took, you have to see it at night; my guide suggested at sunset it is beautiful and even though I didn‚Äôt see it, I would agree it would be just as beautiful.
