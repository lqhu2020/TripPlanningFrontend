The attention to detail in the architecture and the sculptures, like the famous Prometheus statue, is awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Top of the Rock observation deck is a highlight. The 360-degree views of the city skyline, including the Empire State Building and Central Park, are spectacular, especially at sunset. It‚Äôs a photographer‚Äôs paradise.\n\nShopping and dining options are abundant. From high-end boutiques to unique gift shops, there‚Äôs something for everyone. The dining experiences range from casual bites to upscale restaurants, all offering great quality and service.\n\nDuring winter, the ice skating rink is a magical experience, whether you‚Äôre on the ice or just watching from the sidelines. The Christmas tree lighting ceremony is a festive event that brings together locals and tourists in a delightful celebration.\n\nThe staff and guides throughout Rockefeller Center are friendly and informative, adding to the enjoyable experience. It‚Äôs a place where you can feel the pulse of New York City and its rich history.\n\nFor anyone visiting NYC, Rockefeller Center is a must-see destination.

The elevator ride was the first big WOW moment that went over the history of the building and then to the observation deck. With a focus on being environmentally friendly, students and educators and even the general public would be interested in knowing. These are just some of the pictures I took, you have to see it at night; my guide suggested at sunset it is beautiful and even though I didn‚Äôt see it, I would agree it would be just as beautiful.

It‚Äôs also significantly cheaper than the Empire State Building too. Really well organised too. Don‚Äôt be put off if you are asked to queue outside on the pavement. They take people in, in groups depending on your allocated time. Wrap up warm it‚Äôs windy up there!!!",
