Suggestion to get your tickets in advance but the wait was not long because it‚Äôs winter but in the spring it‚Äôs probably longer. The elevator ride was the first big WOW moment that went over the history of the building and then to the observation deck. With a focus on being environmentally friendly, students and educators and even the general public would be interested in knowing. These are just some of the pictures I took, you have to see it at night; my guide suggested at sunset it is beautiful and even though I didn‚Äôt see it, I would agree it would be just as beautiful. They also have a restaurant, bar and gift shop. Discounts for MasterCard holders was nice too. Definitely a treat for New Yorkers who never been and want to explore the place we call home.",

Then when I got up to the top, it was clearly marked on where to go and it was not too busy.\nThere are incredible views from all windows. It is definitely worth getting photos from all different angles and sides of the building.\nOne Dine is also a great restaurant and the $15 off coupon can be put towards anything on the menu.\nOverall, this is a great tourist attraction and a must-do if you come to New York.",

There's the new Top of the Rock attraction where tou can sit on a girder over hanging the city! It's just one of the best places to visit!

Sunsets are spectacular, but coming at night during the Christmas season is something to behold as well. The city is lit up, and with the Empire State Building in the forefront of the southward view toward lower Manhattan, it‚Äôs a live postcard. $30-45 per ticket depending on the time of day. Be sure to go up the stairs to the very top deck for the best views.  No glass to obstruct views up there. And buy your ticket ahead of time.",

It is a very unique experience, hard to explain but it is a bus tour arranged like a theater so you sit looking at the street, the whole ride is a delight laughing from start to finish 2 comedian hosts perform all the time. There are occasional "random"(no random, they are part of the ride) street performers which make the experience even better. It is more a show than a tourist show and that is why it is incredible. There are a lot of sarcasm, improved jokes and audience interactions, a real theater on wheels.\n\nNote: Not recommended if you don\'t know English as it is the only language available so far(dec 2023)',

Great pictures, beautiful views, interesting history.\n\nA ticket is not too expensive, and includes the ferry ride round-trip, access to the statue up to the pedestal, and the museums.\n\nYou can also opt to go to the top of the crown of the statue!  And it's only a few dollars extra (about $26 total per person to visit the statue and go to the top).  I think it's a neat experience to go up there, but be aware - it's very tight in the narrow staircase, lots of stairs, and the crown at the top is a tiny room and has a few small windows to see out of.  We were a bit underwhelmed by the crown experience, BUT it is a once in a lifetime thing, and I'd recommend it if you don't mind being in tight spaces.\n\nLastly, make sure to book the crown tickets well in advance - months in advance!!  They sell out!!",

          text: "Such a neat and memorable experience! We went during winter and though there were still many visitors, there‚Äôs substantially more during the warmer months. The ferries leave frequently and would go from NYC > Statue of Liberty > Ellis Island. It is essentially a shuttle service where you hop on and off. I recommend sitting/standing on the right side of the ferry if you want a good photo of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nI also recommend carving out 6 hours total to be spent on both islands, but if you don‚Äôt have enough time to visit both, I would just focus on the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWe took the stairs up to the pedestal and it was fine as long as you have good cardio health. It is an additional ticket to climb up to the crown and the only way up is by climbing a narrow spiral staircase that‚Äôs dimly lit. If you‚Äôre claustrophobic, afraid of heights, and/or have heart problems then I definitely would not recommend you do this.\n\nOnce inside the crown, you‚Äôll notice it is a fairly cramped space, especially if you‚Äôre tall. There are windows you can view the NYC skyline from and if you squat down you can see her torch and the tips of her crown.\n\nI would also recommend being ones of the first people up there so you can have the whole space to yourself.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty Museum is also a must-visit. You get to see full size replicas of portions of the statue in its original copper state. There‚Äôs SO MANY cool historical memorabilia commemorating the dedication of the statue, plus the old original torch is displayed there.\n\nOverall a fantastic visit and highly recommend going during the winter because it will be incredibly hot both outside and inside while climbing up the statue. We went on a Sunday and there was a large school trip, but they mainly would stick together.",

We purchased tickets online, in advance since we wanted to go up to the pedestal (A 4 person lift is available if you can't climb the stairs. It has a small queue on a weekday). Tickets to climb to the crown (can be reached only by steps from the pedestal) get booked months in advance.\nIt was such a fun experience.. the boat ride is great, you can move around in the indoor and outdoor deck areas. There is a lot of walking once you get to the island, but it was worth visiting for the amazing views of New Jersey & New York City. The statue itself is majestic and there are some great photo points all around. There are washrooms available in the boat as well as on the island.\nKeeping a tab on the boat leaving times helped us to avoid waiting around. We also made a quick stop at Ellis Island and had a look at the museum there.\nOverall, it is an amazing way to spend an afternoon and view one of the most talked about monuments while you are at it!",

A visit to this iconic monument is a profound and moving experience that encapsulates the spirit of the United States.\n\nThe ferry ride to Liberty Island provides a scenic approach, offering panoramic views of the skyline and the statue herself. As you approach, the sheer scale and intricate details of Lady Liberty become more apparent, creating a sense of awe and reverence.\n\nClimbing to the crown or exploring the museum on Liberty Island offers deeper insights into the statue's history and significance. The exhibits beautifully convey the story of its creation, gift from France, and the ideals it represents, making the visit both educational and emotionally resonant.\n\nThe panoramic views of Manhattan from the pedestal and crown are unparalleled, providing a unique perspective of the city skyline. Visitors can also enjoy the tranquility of the surrounding park, offering a peaceful contrast to the vibrant energy of the city.\n\nWhile the queues for the ferry and security checks can be time-consuming, the overall experience of witnessing the Statue of Liberty up close is worth the wait. The symbolism, historical significance, and breathtaking views make a visit to the Statue of Liberty a must for anyone exploring New York City and a poignant reminder of the principles that shape the nation.",

My recent visit to this architectural marvel left an indelible mark, and I feel compelled to share the experience in this detailed review.\n\nFrom the moment you lay eyes on the Empire State Building, its grandeur commands attention. As you approach, the intricate details of its Art Deco design unfold, showcasing the timeless elegance that has made it a beacon in the city skyline for decades. The exterior alone is a work of art, a testament to the rich history and cultural significance that this landmark holds.\n\nUpon entering, the journey through the Empire State Building is both educational and awe-inspiring. The lobby, adorned with period-specific details, sets the tone for the historical immersion that awaits. The knowledgeable and friendly staff contribute to the welcoming atmosphere, ready to assist and share insights about the building's history and significance.\n\nThe ascent to the observation deck is an adventure in itself. The high-speed elevators whisk you to the top in mere moments, providing a thrilling introduction to the panoramic views that await. And oh, what views they are! The observation deck offers a breathtaking 360-degree vantage point of the city, allowing you to witness the sprawling metropolis below and the vast expanse of the horizon beyond. The beauty of Central Park, the glittering lights of Times Square, and the majesty of the surrounding skyscrapers all unfold before your eyes.\n\nThe Empire State Building truly comes alive during sunset. The hues of the sky transform, casting a warm glow over the city, and the city lights begin to twinkle, creating a mesmerizing tableau. It's a spectacle that leaves you in awe of the city that never sleeps, and the experience is made even more magical by the occasional passing clouds, adding an ethereal quality to the view.\n\nHowever, amidst the wonder and enchantment, a slight drawback emerges ‚Äì parking. The wishful longing for a seamless parking experience is met with the reality of the bustling city streets. Finding convenient parking near the Empire State Building can be a challenge, and the limited spaces often result in a time-consuming quest for a suitable spot. It's advisable to plan accordingly, exploring public transportation options or nearby parking facilities to alleviate this minor inconvenience.\n\nIn conclusion, the Empire State Building is not just a structure; it's a living testament to the spirit of New York City. The beauty of its architecture, the historical richness within its walls, and the awe-inspiring views from its observation deck make it a must-visit destination. While the wish for effortless parking remains unfulfilled, the overall experience is a testament to the enduring allure of this iconic landmark. If you seek a profound connection with the heart of New York City and a visual feast for the senses, the Empire State Building is an unparalleled destination that will leave an indelible mark on your memory.",

Located at the intersection of Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, this triangular marvel captivates both locals and tourists with its timeless elegance.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about the Flatiron Building is its distinctive and unconventional design. Shaped like the prow of a ship, the building's triangular form is a captivating sight, especially when viewed from Madison Square Park. The way it gracefully occupies its wedge-shaped plot is a testament to the ingenuity of the architects who brought this structure to life.\n\nConstructed in 1902, the Flatiron Building has seamlessly blended into the cityscape, becoming a beloved part of New York's architectural history. Its Beaux-Arts architectural style exudes a sense of grandeur and sophistication, making it a must-see for those with an appreciation for classic design.\n\nOne of the pleasures of visiting the Flatiron Building is taking a stroll around the neighborhood. The surrounding area, including Madison Square Park, offers picturesque views and photo opportunities, allowing visitors to admire the building from different angles. The ever-changing play of light on the building's facade adds an extra layer of enchantment, making it a favorite subject for photographers.\n\nInside, the Flatiron Building houses a mix of businesses, adding a dynamic aspect to its historic charm. The ground floor hosts retail establishments, creating a lively atmosphere around the building. The ground-level presence of Eataly, an Italian marketplace, adds a modern and gastronomic touch to the historic structure.\n\nWhile the Flatiron Building may not boast the height of some of its neighboring skyscrapers, its significance lies in its pioneering design and cultural impact. It has become a symbol of New York's resilience and adaptability, standing tall as a reminder of the city's rich architectural heritage.",

The Battery, formerly known as Battery Park, is a 25-acre (10 ha) public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City facing New York Harbor. It is bounded by Battery Place on the north, with Bowling Green to the northeast, State Street on the east, New York Harbor to the south, and the Hudson River to the west. The park contains attractions such as an early 19th-century fort named Castle Clinton; multiple monuments; and the SeaGlass Carousel. The surrounding area, known as South Ferry, contains multiple ferry terminals, including the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal; a boat launch to the Statue of Liberty National Monument (which includes Ellis Island and Liberty Island); and a boat launch to Governors Island. q",

          text: "The High Line in New York City offers a unique and immersive urban experience that stands out even in a city known for its incredible parks and public spaces. This elevated linear park, built on a historic freight rail line, has been transformed into an urban oasis that weaves through the bustling streets of Manhattan's West Side.\n\nFrom the moment you ascend the staircases to the High Line, you're greeted by a fusion of nature, art, and design. The park's layout harmoniously integrates the industrial elements of the original railway with lush plantings, contemporary art installations, and panoramic views of the city and the Hudson River.\n\nAs you stroll along the High Line, there's a palpable sense of calm that contrasts with the energetic pulse of the city below. The landscaping is thoughtfully curated, with a mix of wildflowers, grasses, and trees that change with the seasons, providing a haven for birds and insects and a splash of color against the urban backdrop.\n\nThe park is also a cultural hub, offering a variety of public programs and art installations that provoke thought and conversation. The integration of art with nature invites visitors to reflect on the relationship between urban spaces and the environment.\n\nSeating areas and viewing platforms are strategically placed to take advantage of the vistas, making it a perfect spot to relax and people-watch. The High Line also features food vendors offering a selection of treats and refreshments, adding to the overall enjoyment of the experience.\n\nAccessibility is a key feature of the High Line, with multiple entry points and elevator access ensuring that everyone can enjoy what the park has to offer. It's not just a walk in the park; it's an embodiment of New York City's spirit of innovation and its commitment to urban renewal and public space.\n\nIn essence, the High Line is more than just a park; it's a testament to the power of community vision and the potential for urban transformation. It's a must-visit destination for locals and tourists alike, offering a unique perspective on the city and a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of urban life.",

There are multiple entry and exit points however it‚Äôs a good idea to go from the Chelsea Markets and then go down to the shops in Hudson Yard, or the other way around.\n\nCan imagine this makes for a nice night walk and is amazing in Autumn or when snowing.\n\nWould I go again: Yes\nDo I recommend: Yes",
